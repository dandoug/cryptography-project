# Simon Singh Cipher Challenge

The Cipher Challenge was a set of ten encrypted messages to be found at the end of [The Code Book](https://simonsingh.net/books/the-code-book/the-book/), a history of codes and code breaking that \[Simon Singh\] published \[in 1999\]. In addition to the intellectual reward of cracking all ten messages, there was a prize of £10,000 for the first person to solve the Challenge.

The Challenge was officially solved on October 7, 2000, after one year and one month of arduous effort by codebreakers, amateur and professional, around the world. \[A page on [simonsingh.net](https://simonsingh.net/cryptography/cipher-challenge/)\] attempts to tell the story behind the Cipher Challenge. It also contains [essays](https://simonsingh.net/cryptography/cipher-challenge/cipher-challenge-essays/) by Jim Gillogly and John Palagyi, who might be considered as runners-up, and a [highly readable 40-page report by the Swedish team who solved the Challenge](https://simonsingh.net/cryptography/cipher-challenge/).

## The Ciphertexts

This page links you to the ten ciphertexts that constituted the Cipher Challenge.

The competition is over and the £10,000 has now been won. Indeed, the solutions are available on-line via a paper written by the winners. However, you might still want to take up the challenge.

[Stage 1](ciphertexts/stage01.md) and [Stage 2](ciphertexts/stage02.md) are relatively easy.

[Stage 3](ciphertexts/stage03.md) and [Stage 4](ciphertexts/stage04.md) are harder – 3 is possibly harder than 4, so I would encourage you to skip 3 if you get stuck.

[Stage 5](ciphertexts/stage05.md) proved to be notoriously difficult.

[Stage 6](ciphertexts/stage06.md), [Stage 7](ciphertexts/stage07.md) and [Stage 8](ciphertexts/stage08.md) are tough, but were cracked by amateurs.

[Stage 9](ciphertexts/stage09.md) requires some computer power.

[Stage 10](ciphertexts/stage10.md) requires lots of computer power and even more brain power.

Good luck.
