# Cipher Challenge Project

I read [The Code Book](https://simonsingh.net/books/the-code-book/the-book/) by Simon Singh in 2025 and decided to work through the [Cipher Challenge](SINGH-CIPHER-CHALLENGE.md) (or as much as I could) for my own education and entertainment.  I gathered the [texts and their descriptions](SINGH-CIPHER-CHALLENGE.md) here in this project as a starting point.

I also found some helpful resources on the internet that will aid me as I work through the coding aspects of the project.

## Resources

* [Wikipedia English Letter Frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency)
* [SOCR Letter Frequency Data](https://wiki.socr.umich.edu/index.php/SOCR_LetterFrequencyData) provides average frequencies for Latin letters in languages like English, German, French, Spanish, and others.
* [Sttmedia.com](https://www.sttmedia.com/) offers specific data on [German alphabet and character frequency](https://www.sttmedia.com/characterfrequency-german), which may be helpful for analyzing German text.
* Cornell University’s Math Explorer’s Project also has [frequency tables for cryptographic purposes](https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~mec/2003-2004/cryptography/subs/frequencies.html). As well as a [collection of substition cipher challenges](https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~mec/2003-2004/cryptography/subs/substitution.html).
* [Richard Knights](https://www.richkni.co.uk/) maintains a [site with some cryptographic information](https://www.richkni.co.uk/php/crypta/index.php).
* [Letterfrequency.org](https://letterfrequency.org/) provides a [breakdown of letter frequencies across various languages](https://letterfrequency.org/letter-frequency-by-language/) as well as other useful frequencey tables.

## Programming Libraries

*  Python’s [cryptography](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/) or [pycipher](https://pycipher.readthedocs.io/en/master/) packages for implementing ciphers and analyzing text.

## Books and Articles
